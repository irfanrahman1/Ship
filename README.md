# Ship

## Overview
This project is a simple 2D Unity game called "Ship," where the player controls a ship that can move forward, rotate, and wrap around the screen edges. This project serves as an introduction to Unity game development, covering basic concepts such as scene setup, sprite management, input handling, physics, and scripting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unity Hub
- Unity Editor
- Visual Studio or another compatible IDE for editing C# scripts

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository or download the project:** If you have git installed, you can clone the repository using the following command:
git clone [repository-url]

Alternatively, download the project as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Open the project in Unity Hub:** Launch Unity Hub, go to the "Projects" tab, and click on "ADD". Navigate to the project folder and select it. Unity will then import the project and its assets.

3. **Open the project in the Unity Editor:** Once the project appears in your Unity Hub projects list, click on it to open the project in the Unity Editor.

### Running the Game
- In the Unity Editor, navigate to the "Scene0" in the "Scenes" folder.
- Press the play button on the top center of the Unity Editor to run the game.
